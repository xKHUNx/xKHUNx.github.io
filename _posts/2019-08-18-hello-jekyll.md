### Welcome

This is a blog I have created with uisng Jekyll forked from [here](https://github.com/kaeyleo/jekyll-theme-H2O). I hope to share some of the topics I find interesting, including, but not limited to AI technology, web development, science, history and more!

### Wait a minute? Who are you?

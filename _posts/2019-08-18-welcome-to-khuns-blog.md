### Welcome
![welcome_gif](https://media1.giphy.com/media/FQyQEYd0KlYQ/giphy.gif)

I hope to share some of the topics I find interesting, including, but not limited to AI technology, web development, science, history and more!

### Wait a minute? Who are you?
![kazoo_kid_gif](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/UntidyMemorableBangeltiger-small.gif)

I am Goh Kun Shun, but I prefer to be called ***Khun***. I'm from Malaysia. I have graduated from Multimedia University, Cyberjaya with a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. I major in data science and I am interested in the development of AI technology, especially in the field of NLP (natural language processing). 

In case you didn't noticed, I love memes and I even had my own [meme page](https://www.facebook.com/I-dont-make-memes-I-stole-them-1174592176045115/) on Facebook.

### Why did you start this blog?

I had always wanted to had my own blog, but I never had the time to start one until my friend introduced me to [this tutorial](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), where I learned how to start my own blog using GitHub. I hope to use this blog as a platform to share things I find useful or interesting to this world. 

I hoped you enjoyed the content!

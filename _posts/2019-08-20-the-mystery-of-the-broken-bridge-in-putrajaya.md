### The Bridge
![seri-wawasan-bridge](/assets/img/putrajaya-bridge/wawasan-bridge.jpg)

If you ever went to Putrajaya, you will notice that there are a lot of bridges there. There are at least 6 bridges. The Seri Wawasan Bridge and Seri Saujana Bridge are especially beautiful in the night, with colorful lightings illuminating the bridges.

Then, there is this one bridge,  sitting in the middle of these two majestic bridges. You can barely notice it during the night.

But on the broad daylight, if you take a closer look, you will notice that the bridge is disconnected from the land! Yeap, it's basically useless.

### Wait a minute? Who are you?

I am Goh Kun Shun, but I prefer to be called ***Khun***. I'm from Malaysia. I have graduated from Multimedia University, Cyberjaya with a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. I major in data science and I am interested in the development of AI technology, especially in the field of NLP (natural language processing). 

In case you didn't noticed, I love memes and I even had my own [meme page](https://www.facebook.com/I-dont-make-memes-I-stole-them-1174592176045115/) on Facebook.

### Why did you start this blog?

I had always wanted to had my own blog, but I never had the time to start one until my friend introduced me to [this tutorial](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), where I learned how to start my own blog using GitHub. I hope to use this blog as a platform to share things I find useful or interesting to this world. 

I hoped you enjoyed the content!

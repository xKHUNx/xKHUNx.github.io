### Putrajaya - the City of Bridges

*The Seri Wawasan Bridge in the night.*

If you ever went to Putrajaya, you will notice that there are a lot of bridges there. There are at least 6 bridges. The Seri Wawasan Bridge and Seri Saujana Bridge are especially beautiful in the night, with colorful lightings illuminating the bridges.

Then, there is this one bridge, sitting between these two majestic bridges. You can barely notice it during the night.

But on the broad daylight, if you take a closer look, you will notice that the bridge is disconnected from the land! Yeap, it's basically useless.

### The Bridge

*If you looked closely, you will see the bridge is disconnected from the land.*

I first stumble upon this odd bridge where my friend and I were hanging out in Putrajaya during the night. I kinda noticed the bridge seems odd, but I reason it was just dark and I couldn't see the bridge clearly.

The second time, I was there with my family under the broad daylight. We quickly noticed the bridge is really disconnected from the land, on both sides. We had some pictures and moved on to somewhere else. But, these questions kept popping in my mind: **Who built these bridge? Why is it disconnected? What purpose does it serve?**

### The Investigation

*You can find the bridge from Google Map.*

The very next day, I pull out my laptop and started Googling about the mysterious bridge. I typed in 'putrajaya broken bridge', half expecting a Wikipedia page to show up. Instead, a Google Map shows up, with the pinpointing a place called 'Putrajaya Broken Bridge'. 

So I clicked in and realized it was the same bridge I was looking for. But this doesn't answer my questions. So I took a closer look, and found another location, called 'Jambatan Monorel Putrajaya'. For those who don't understand Malay, it translates to English as  'Putrajaya Monorail  Bridge'.

And bam! I found our first lead. So for some reason, there are two locations referring to the same bridge. Anyway, Googling with 'Putrajaya Monorail  Bridge' yields a Wikipedia page (finally!) titled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya_Monorail" target="_blank">Hello, world!</a>.
